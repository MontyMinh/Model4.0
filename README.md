# Optimizer 4.0

The **Optimizer 4.0** optimize based on inbound and outbound logistics cost. It improves on several aspect of Model 3.0.

1. It features a more vectorized implementation of the constraints matrix
2. It separates the program into 3 different stages: preprocessing, optimizing, and postprocessing, compared to one
   combined block in Model 3.0.
3. The set of optimized products is more flexible and can be defined by the user.
4. It also allows for capacity constraints on a subset of products.
5. The documentation of the program is more extensive and detailed.

Technical details of these improvements are found in the [white paper].
